THIS IS NOT A STANDARD AI MODEL.

Dephaze UDT is a "Zero-Fit" cognitive architecture that solves the AI hallucination problem by separating **Structure** (Memory) from **Generation** (Creativity).

It combines:
1.  **Deterministic Ontology** (The UDT V1 core)
2.  **Generative Flux** (The Phi^3 Motor)
3.  **Topological Validation** (The Gödel Filter)

This repository contains the complete, frozen, canonical implementation.

### 1. THE SIGNIFICANCE (Why use this?)

Standard LLMs mix memory and creativity in a black box, leading to uncontrollable hallucinations. 
Dephaze UDT separates them:

*   **The Body (UDT):** A rigid, deterministic phase-space map. It never lies. If it knows a fact, it returns it with 100% stability.
*   **The Soul (Flux Motor):** A generative engine based on $\Phi^3$ geometry. It creates new ideas ("controlled hallucinations") only when necessary.
*   **The Mind (Gödel Filter):** A topological auditor. It checks if the Flux Motor's new idea resonates with the existing map. 
    *   If it fits topology -> **Hypothesis**.
    *   If it breaks topology -> **Noise (Rejected)**.

**Result:** A system that can be creative without being delusional.

### 2. HOW TO BUILD THE FULL SYSTEM (Installation & Growth)

This repository provides the **Engine**. To make it a "Full System" (a wise Oracle), you must provide the **Stars** (Knowledge).

#### A. Installation
1.  Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed.
2.  Install dependencies: `pip install numpy requests`
3.  Unzip this package.

#### B. Running the Engine (The Console)
To see the system think, decide, and generate hypotheses:
`python run_udt.py`

*   **Try:** Enter known terms (e.g., "cat"). The system uses the UDT Structure (Fact).
*   **Try:** Enter abstract/new concepts. The system detects low confidence, ignites the **Flux Motor**, generates a hypothesis, and the **Gödel Filter** validates it against your Atlas.

#### C. Running Headless (CLI / Scripting)
`python cli.py "your query here" --flux-threshold 0.95`

#### D. **CRITICAL STEP: Growing the Atlas**
The system comes with a minimal Atlas (2-3 stars). To make it intelligent, you must map reality into it. 
**You do not train it.** You commit stars.

1.  Use the Commit Tool:
    `python atlas_commit.py "Quantum mechanics"`
    `python atlas_commit.py "General relativity"`
    `python atlas_commit.py "Topology"`

2.  **What happens?** 
    The tool calculates the precise Phase Coordinate ($\theta, \phi, \rho$) of the concept and "anchors" it in `atlas_stars.json`.

3.  **The Result:**
    As you add stars, the **Gödel Filter** becomes smarter. It stops linking hypotheses to 'unknown' and starts linking them to specific domains (e.g., "Hypothesis linked to 'Physics'").

### 3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

**Input** (String) 
   ↓
**Phase Projection** (Imago) -> *Maps text to geometry*
   ↓
**Lambda Engine** (Resolver) -> *Checks known stars*
   ↓
   ├─ **If High Confidence:** -> Return FACT (UDT)
   │
   └─ **If Low Confidence:** -> **IGNITE FLUX MOTOR** ($\Phi^3$)
          ↓
      **Generative Twist** -> *Creates new phase candidate*
          ↓
      **Gödel Filter** -> *Audits topology against Atlas*
          ↓
      **Verdict** -> HYPOTHESIS or NOISE

### 4. SYSTEM STATE (VERIFIED)

*   **Status:** STABLE (Hybrid Mode)
*   **Determinism:** HARD (Flux uses seed-based entropy)
*   **Learning:** STRUCTURAL (via Atlas Commits, no backprop)
*   **Hallucination:** CONTROLLED (Filtered by Gödel)
*   **Memory:** PERMANENT (Atlas stars do not fade)
